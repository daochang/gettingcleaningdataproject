The raw data consists of data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ using a Samsung smart phone as part of an experiment to see how such data varies with different activities a person wearing the phone engages in.

Some info on the data

The time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The run_analysis file first reads in the 8 files mentioned in the README file on
the GitHub repo into R. The following steps are done to process the data:

The data frames containing subject identifiers (participants), training labels 
(denoting the type of activity done), and the feature data collected by the 
smart phone are merged, for both the training and test data.


The complete test and training datasets are merged using rowbind function to
produce 1 big dataset.

Columns 3 to 563 in this dataset are renamed with the help of the data in the 
features.txt file. Columns 1 and 2 are renames "subject" and "activity" to reflect their contents.

With reference to the activity_labels.txt file, a vector of activity names was
created, and this was used to map to the numbers in the big dataset to produce 
a more readable and meaningful dataset.

The grep function is used to extract only the feature data that contains mean and 
frequency. Subject and activity columns are kept intact. Columns with "meanfreq" are ignored, as they are weighted averages of the frequency components and not means of a single
feature per se.

Using the dplyr package, a tidy data frame of summary data containing the mean of the feature data per activity, per subject is created, with a total of 180 rows and 68 columns resulting.
